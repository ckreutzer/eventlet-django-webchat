An example of an COMET chat application taken from facebook's (friendfeed actually) 
python based tornado web framework and converted to use django and eventlet.

based upon the gevent port of that tornado example by Denis Bilenko (here:
http://bitbucket.org/denis/gevent/src/tip/examples/webchat/ and here:
http://prg10001.blogspot.com/2009/09/simpler-long-polling-with-django-and.htm). 
The original tornado version can be found here: 
http://github.com/facebook/tornado/tree/master/demos/chat/

To start the server, run
$ python run.py

or using spawing (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Spawning/)
$ spawn --processes=1 --threads=0 run.application
